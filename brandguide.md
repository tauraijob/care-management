Best Practice Rules
✔ Keep Navy Blue dominant across digital and print materials.
✔ Use Secondary Colours for balance, readability, and softer backgrounds.
✔ Apply Accent Orange only to guide user attention (CTAs, links).
✔ Maintain strong contrast for accessibility (text should always be legible).
Avoid
❌ Overusing the accent colour – it should only &#39;pop&#39;, not dominate.
❌ Using accent colour as a background fill.

❌ Mixing colours randomly outside of this guide.
❌ Changing logo colours outside of this approved palette.
